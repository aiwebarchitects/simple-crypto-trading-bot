# Low/High Reversal Strategy Backtester

A comprehensive backtesting system for cryptocurrency trading that implements a low/high reversal strategy using real market data from Binance.

![Back Testing](backtesting.png)

## üéØ Strategy Overview

This backtester implements a **Low/High Reversal Strategy** that:

### Long Positions (Buy Low)
- Identifies significant price lows using technical analysis
- Enters long positions by buying **0.15% above** significant lows
- Targets price reversals after major drops

### Short Positions (Sell High)
- Identifies daily high points in price action
- Enters short positions by selling **0.15% below** daily highs
- Profits from price corrections after peaks

### Risk Management
- **Stop Loss**: Configurable percentage-based stop losses (3-8%)
- **Trailing Stops**: Dynamic profit protection (1-4%)
- **Position Sizing**: Fixed capital allocation per trade

## üîç What the Backtester Does

### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches top cryptocurrencies by market cap from CoinGecko
- Downloads historical price data from Binance API
- Uses hourly candlestick data for accurate backtesting
- Implements intelligent caching to reduce API calls

### 2. Opportunity Detection

#### Significant Lows Algorithm
- Analyzes 40+ data points around each potential low
- Requires minimum 1% drop before the low
- Requires minimum 1% recovery after the low
- Calculates significance scores based on drop magnitude and recovery

#### Daily Highs Algorithm
- Groups data by trading days
- Identifies the highest price point of each day
- Filters for days with meaningful price ranges (>1%)
- Ranks opportunities by daily volatility

### 3. Parameter Optimization
Tests multiple parameter combinations:
- **Long Offset**: 0.05% to 0.30% (entry above lows)
- **Short Offset**: 0.05% to 0.30% (entry below highs)
- **Stop Loss**: 3% to 8% (maximum loss per trade)
- **Trailing Stop**: 1% to 4% (profit protection)

### 4. Strategy Simulation
- Simulates real trading conditions
- Tracks capital allocation and position management
- Implements realistic entry/exit mechanics
- Calculates comprehensive performance metrics

### 5. Performance Analysis
Generates detailed metrics including:
- **Total Return**: Overall profit/loss percentage
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Trade Statistics**: Number of trades, average wins/losses

## üìä Output Results

### 3. Log Files
Detailed execution logs stored in `logs/low_high_reversal_backtester.log`

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Backtester
```bash
# Run with default settings (top 30 coins, 7 days)
python3 backtest/multi_token_backtester_low_high_reversal.py
```

### Configuration Options
Edit the configuration variables in the script:

```python
BACKTEST_DAYS = 7                    # Number of days to backtest
INITIAL_CAPITAL = 100.0              # Starting capital for simulation
MAX_CONCURRENT_BACKTESTS = 5         # Parallel processing limit

# Parameter optimization ranges
LONG_OFFSET_RANGE = (0.05, 0.30, 0.05)   # Min, Max, Step
SHORT_OFFSET_RANGE = (0.05, 0.30, 0.05)
STOP_LOSS_RANGE = (3.0, 8.0, 1.0)
TRAILING_STOP_RANGE = (1.0, 4.0, 0.5)
```
